## ⚠️ Failing Tests (10/49)

### Category: Deprecated Puppeteer API (Non-Critical)

All 10 failures are due to `page.waitForTimeout()` being deprecated in newer Puppeteer versions. **This does NOT affect application functionality** - it's a test framework issue.

**Affected Tests:**
1. Toggle between Ukraine/Custom modes
2. API key input field interaction
3. Checkbox toggle testing
4. Custom forecast mode handling
5. Timeframe input testing
6. Responsive breakpoint testing
7. Layout shift measurement
8. Keyboard navigation focus
9. Focus indicator visibility
10. Page title verification (actual failure - title doesn't contain "Foresight")

**Fix:** Replace `page.waitForTimeout(ms)` with:
```javascript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
```
